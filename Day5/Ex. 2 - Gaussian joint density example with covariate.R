# Example 2: Assume now that species richness counts depend on a covariate,
#            taken at different elevations in a mountain range
#            (species richness usually declines with increasing elevation)

# Although this is ALSO not an integrated model according to our definition (since the data sets are 
# NOT 'disparate'), it does nevertheless illustrate two important features that any joint density
# shares with the joint density of an integrated model
# - the density of each data point is different, but we formulate the joint density
#   as a function of parameters that are shared: these are the alpha and the beta and the sd
# - and then, as always: more data produce 'better' (more precise) estimates
# - in the extreme case where we have fewer data points than params, can't even estimate things
